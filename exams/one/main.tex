This exam contains \numpages\ pages (including this cover page) and
\numquestions\ problems.
Check to see if any pages are missing.
Enter all requested information on the top of this page, and put your initials
on the top of every page, in case the pages become separated.\\

You may \textit{not} use your books, notes, or \textbf{any calculator} on this exam.\\

You are encouraged to show your work on each problem on this exam.  The following rules apply:\\

\begin{minipage}[t]{3.7in}
\vspace{0pt}
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Organize your work}, in a reasonably neat and coherent way, in
the space provided. Work scattered all over the page without a clear ordering will 
receive very little credit.  

\item \textbf{Box your final answer} and label the solution with the appropriate variables (if applicable).

\item \textbf{Simplify your final answer}. A correct answer, written in an unsimplified way, will receive less than full credit. All fractions must be written such that the numerator and denominator share no common factors.

\item If you need more space, use the back of the pages; clearly indicate when you have done this.
\end{itemize}

Do not write in the table to the right.

\vfill
\part[2] $$ 105 $$
\vfill
\part[2] $$ 121 $$
\vfill

\question Solve:
\begin{parts}
\part[5] $$5x - 3 = 22$$
\vfill
\part[5] $$\frac{3}{5} = \frac{12}{10}x$$
\vfill
\part[5] $$ \frac{7}{n - 2} - \frac{4}{n + 3} = 0 $$
\vfill
\part[5] $$\frac{x-3}{2} + 2 = \frac{14}{8}$$
\vfill
\part[5] $$\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{6}x$$
\vfill
\end{parts}

% Manipulate Formula
\newpage
\addpoints
\question Solve for the specified variable:
\begin{parts}
\part[5] $$ F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \text{,\quad for }C$$
\vfill
\part[5] $$ y = mx + b \text{,\quad for }m$$

\vfill
\part[5] $$-2x - 5 < 3$$
\vfill
\part[5] $$ 2(x+3) + 3(x-6) < 14 $$

\end{parts}

% If you want the total number of points for a question displayed at the top,
% as well as the number of points for each part, then you must turn off the point-counter
% or they will be double counted.
\newpage
\question[30] Set up and solve the following word problems:
\noaddpoints % If you remove this line, the grading table will show 20 points for this problem.
\begin{parts}
\part Siri is half as old as Vasher.
Ten years ago Vasher was triple Siri's age.
How old are Siri and Vasher now?
\vfill
\part A triangular plot of ground has a perimeter of 54 yards.
The longest side is twice the shortest side, and the third side is 2 years longer than the second side.
Find the lengths of the sides of the triangle.
\vfill
\part Albert has won 45 tennis games and lost 55 games.
They have 62 more games to play.
